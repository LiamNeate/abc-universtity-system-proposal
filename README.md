# ABC Universtity System Proposal
This is a proposed system report for ABC University and their contact tracing app. This was made by a group of 4 people, including me. For this proposal, I acted as the project manager.

# Full scenario

The ABC University is one of the most well-known universities in the UK. Despite all their effort, having different
campuses has made it difficult for them to keep track of their COVID-19 positive cases.
You are acting as a system analyst team in the ABC University. During an urgent meeting with the University
Management Team, you have been asked about the possibility of developing an internal contact tracing app. The
management team believes that it will be beneficial to them to launch an app enabling students and staff to report
symptoms of COVID-19, so that the progression of the disease on campuses can be tracked in real time. This app aims
to help slow the outbreak of COVID-19 by helping the University Management Team determine how fast the virus is
spreading across different campuses, identify high-risk areas and identify those who are most at risk. This app will
allow students and staff to record information about their health on a daily basis, including temperature, tiredness and
symptoms such as coughing, breathing problems or headache.
The University Management Team does not want the internal
contact tracing app to have major differences in its functionalities
or look from the other well-known apps like the NHS Test and
Trace app. However, they want to be able to respond to potential
and positive cases and/or potential outbreaks across their campuses.
This app will also allow them to offer support to individuals and
check on their wellbeing. This app is not only useful for the current
situation, but it can also be used as a crisis response app and help
the university management team to coordinate their own
information sharing and team collaboration in response to evolving
conditions in times of crisis.
Your team are required to use your object-oriented system analysis skills and knowledge to conceptualise this new
ideas. Your aim is to produce a System Proposal Report for this new business need.
